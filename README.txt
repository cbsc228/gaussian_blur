Gaussian Blur

----DESCRIPTION----

This programs implements image blurring using 5x5 weight kernels to blur each pixel
based on it's neighbors. The program opens with a default image loaded and has one
other image included. Five different levels of blurring ranging from a stigma of 1.0
to 3.0 can be applied to the current image. After an image has been blurred it can be
reset back to the original image. The program also allows the user to navigate a file
explorer to use their own image. Only .jpg and .png images are allowed for usage 
however.
